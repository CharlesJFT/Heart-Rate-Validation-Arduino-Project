# In this project heart rate was measured and validated by two different sensors through different channels (analog and digital) using the ESP 8266 Node MCU in Arduino IDE. SPo2 was also measured. 
# The code allows for a dashboard display of measurements on Adafruit IO. 
# WiFi compatibility and a portable charger allow the device to be portable.
# The Arduino Sketch file is also provided.
